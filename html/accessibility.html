            <p>I ran the test on the site <a href="https://validator.w3.org">validator.w3.org</a> 
             and had a few mistakes that I did correct.  
             E.g. I had a wrong input type in the html code 
             of the booking page. I had to search up the answer
             and I did find an answer that I needed to 
             adjust a little before it was correct to use 
             in the code. 
             
             In the index code the validator 
             found a stray closing div tag. I am glad that 
             the validator found it, otherwise I would’ve 
             missed it, and that wouldn’t be very good on an
             exam. It also caught a space in one of the paths
             to a picture on the menu page. There was a
             space between the name of the document and   
             the .jpg. I did see that, and I thought it
             would be fine, but the validator said
             otherwise. I did not have any issues with 
             this while coding or after reviewing the
             finished page, but I did correct the 
             mistake because of the possibilities of
             something happening. Better safe than
             sorry, am I right.
            <br>
            <br>
             Another warning i did get was that i couldn't use the input
             statement for writing a message. I did not encounter any problems
             with this when working or after finishing, but if it is wrong then
             i would need to fix it, and i did.

             <br>
             there are three pictures given below that show some of the things i 
             got wrong and that have been fixed.

             <br>
             <p>I do have a problem that doesn’t make sense to me.
                 It says that my opening body tag is seen but
                  there already is another element of the same 
                  type that is open. See picture below (17.11.22)
                
                  <br>
                  After a good bit of research, i did not get any closer
                  to the answer that i was seeking. so i went to orakel
                  and asked the, if they knew. and they did. it turns out
                  that header tag need to be inside of the body tag. and
                  with that, all my mistakes are fixed. I have been using
                  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">w3schools</a>
                  alot and that is probably the reason for me not having
                  more mistakes. 
                  <br>
                  <br> 
                  all of the css code has also been checked
                  and that is good as well. 
                </p>
