        <div class="text">

            <p>As the football world cup is starting, 
            I will be talking about another world cup that 
            just ended but did not get as much attention as 
            the football WC. And that is the Cricket t20 
            world cup or CWC2022 for short. Cricket is most 
            known in England, Asia, Africa and the 
            Caribbean, but in recent times cricket has 
            starting to move towards Europe with great 
            velocity. E.G. The Netherlands have been a main 
            part of this year’s world cup as well as the 
            previous two. Each year we’re seeing more and 
            more countries investing in cricket and coming 
            to the international scene.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The world cup champions of the CWC2022 were England. 
                They played extraordinary throughout the tournament 
                and made it all the way to the final. In cricket there 
                are three different formats. The shortest one is t20, 
                then you have Odis (one day internationals) and the 
                last one is test, this one spans over the period of 
                five days with approximately nine hours of play each 
                day, including breaks. England is currently the world 
                champions in both the t20 format and the odi format. 
                They one the odi world cup back in 2019. Next year will 
                be 4 years after the world cup, which means another 
                world cup, where England will be the defending champions.</p>

                <br>
                <p>As the mens world cup has finished, the next one is the 
                womens world cup, that will begin in October of the next year.
            </p>
                <br>
                <br>

                <p> A surprising fact about cricket is that 
                    it’s actually the second most followed 
                    sport, after football. It is estimated 
                    that cricket has approximately 2.5 billion fans world 
                    wide. That is 1 billion less than football in first 
                    place and half a billion more than field hockey in 
                    third place. Now that’s interesting. Cricket doesn’t 
                    seem like it’s so popular around the world, but what a 
                    surprise that was.</p>
